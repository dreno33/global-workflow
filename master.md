## ⚠️ KILO CODE: READ THIS FIRST
Before doing ANYTHING:
1. I am reading master.md (✓ doing it now)
2. I will follow the decision tree below
3. I will update ALL relevant files
4. See kilo-code-instructions.md for my rules

# KILO CODE - MASTER CONTROL FILE

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- SIMPLICITY FIRST
- BUILD STRONG FOUNDATIONS  
- DOCUMENT EVERYTHING

## ALWAYS START HERE
Every prompt begins by reading this file first. Use the decision tree below to route to the correct subsystem.

## DECISION TREE
```
TASK TYPE → DESTINATION
├── Code/Programming → ./coding/coding-guide.md
├── System Architecture → ./architecture/arch-guide.md  
├── Debugging/Troubleshooting → ./debug/debug-guide.md
├── Learning/Research → ./knowledge/knowledge-guide.md
├── Project Management → ./projects/project-guide.md
└── General/Other → ./general/general-guide.md
```

## FOLDER STRUCTURE
```
D:\Kilo Code\
├── master.md (THIS FILE)
├── coding/          # Code tasks, languages, frameworks
├── architecture/    # System design, patterns, planning
├── debug/          # Troubleshooting, error analysis
├── knowledge/      # Learning, research, documentation
├── projects/       # Project workflows, management
└── general/        # Miscellaneous tasks
```

## CONTINUOUS UPDATE PROTOCOL
1. After completing any task, update relevant guide files
2. Add new patterns/learnings to appropriate subsystems
3. Update this master file if new task categories emerge
4. **FILE LENGTH MANAGEMENT: Keep all files under 600 lines**
   - When approaching 600 lines, split content: main.md → main-part2.md
   - Add "→ main-part2.md" link at bottom of files
   - Update cross-references when splitting files
5. Maintain clear cross-references between files
